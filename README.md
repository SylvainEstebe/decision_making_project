## Abstract
This paper examines how real and perceived insecurity affect conditional cooperation in a public goods game. By examining whether the perceived insecurity index in a country and the overall outcome for the group in the game are correlated. Furthermore, I further apply a decision model to examine whether individual decisions differ in terms of social decision dynamics. I use an existing dataset of groups playing a public goods game in thirteen economically diverse societies. The results suggest that the experience of insecurity does not affect contribution, but people coming from nations with higher levels of perceived insecurity contribute less. Furthermore, I find that a higher worry index is associated with lower initial optimism regarding others' contributions at the beginning of the game and increased sensitivity to others’ contributions, which accelerates the decay of cooperation.
